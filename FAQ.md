### How did you get the idea for Conquer Chess?

As a Dutch Starcraft II fan, I regularily watch videos
from Simon 'Lowko' Heijnen (e.g. at [Lowko](https://lowko.tv/)).
He sometimes calls Starcraft II 'high-speed chess'.
Because I incompletely agree with him,
I pondered on what high-speed chess would look like.
Conquer Chess is the result of those thoughts.

## Game rules

### What are the rules of Conquer Chess compared to chess?

Conquer Chess tries to follow as much rules of chess as possible.
All pieces move and attack in the same way as regular chess.

However, due to the real-time nature of Conquer Chess, 
these are the differences:

:construction: the exact rules are still under construction :construction:

 * Goal is to destroy the opponent's king
 * All pieces have health
 * All pieces have an equal amount of health 
 * All pieces move in the same directions as regular chess.
   For example, pawns move forward, bishops move diagonally and rooks move horizontally
 * All pieces move equally fast
 * Pieces cannot move to occupied squares
   Squares occupied by the opponent's pieces must be attacked first
 * All pieces attack in the same directions and with the same distance as regular chess.
   For example, pawns attack to forward diagonally-adjacent squares
   and bishops attack diagonally for any amount of squares
 * A piece is destroyed if its health reaches zero
 * When a piece starts moving, it can be attacked at its departure square
   until it reaches halfway to the next square
 * When a piece is moving and halfway to its target square, 
   it can be attacked at its target square
 * Multiple pieces can attack the same opponents piece
 * When a piece is destroyed, 
   all its attacker will automatically try to capture the square.
   Note that the closest piece will be successfull, 
   the others will move back to the square they occupied before the attack
 * Castling can only be done when (1) the king has not moved,
   (2) the desired rook has not moved, (3) there are no pieces
   in the way. Castling can take place through check and to check,
   but the king will take more damage when attacked
 * A pawn can attack by en-passant, for a limited amount of time

## Game settings
