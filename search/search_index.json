Algebraic Notation","text":"<p>FIDE recognises for its own tournaments and matches only one system of notation, the Algebraic System, and recommends the use of this uniform chess notation also for chess literature and periodicals. Scoresheets using a notation system other than algebraic may not be used as evidence in cases where normally the scoresheet of a player is used for that purpose. An arbiter who observes that a player is using a notation system other than the algebraic should warn the player of this requirement.</p> <p>Description of the Algebraic System</p> <p>C.1    In this description, \u2018piece' means a piece other than a pawn.</p> <p>C.2    Each piece is indicated by an abbreviation. In the English language it is the first letter, a capital letter, of its name. Example: K=king, Q=queen, R=rook, B=bishop, N=knight. (N is used for a knight, in order to avoid ambiguity.)</p> <p>C.3    For the abbreviation of the name of the pieces, each player is free to use the name which is commonly used in his/her country. Examples: F = fou (French for bishop), L = loper (Dutch for bishop). In printed periodicals, the use of figurines is recommended.</p> <p>C.4    Pawns are not indicated by their first letter, but are recognised by the absence of such a letter. Examples: the moves are written e5, d4, a5, not pe5, Pd4, pa5.</p> <p>C.5    The eight files (from left to right for White and from right to left for Black) are indicated by the small letters, a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h, respectively.</p> <p>C.6    The eight ranks (from bottom to top for White and from top to bottom for Black) are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, respectively. Consequently, in the initial position the white pieces and pawns are placed on the first and second ranks; the black pieces and pawns on the eighth and seventh ranks.</p> <p>C.7    As a consequence of the previous rules, each of the sixty-four squares is invariably indicated by a unique combination of a letter and a number.</p> <p>C.8    Each move of a piece is indicated by the abbreviation of the name of the piece in question and the square of arrival. There is no need for a hyphen between name and square. Examples: Be5, Nf3, Rd1.</p> <p>In the case of pawns, only the square of arrival is indicated. Examples: e5, d4, a5.</p> <p>A longer form containing the square of departure is acceptable. Examples: Bb2e5, Ng1f3, Ra1d1, e7e5, d2d4, a6a5.</p> <p>C.9    When a piece makes a capture, an x may be inserted between:</p> <p>C.9.1    the abbreviation of the name of the piece in question and</p> <p>C.9.2    the square of arrival. Examples: Bxe5, Nxf3, Rxd1, see also C.10.</p> <p>C.9.3    When a pawn makes a capture, the file of departure must be indicated, then an x may be inserted, then the square of arrival. Examples: dxe5, gxf3, axb5. In the case of an \u2018en passant' capture, \u2018e.p.' may be appended to the notation. Example: exd6 e.p.</p> <p>C.10  If two identical pieces can move to the same square, the piece that is moved is indicated as follows:</p> <p>C.10.1    If both pieces are on the same rank by:</p> <p>C.10.1.1    The abbreviation of the name of the piece,</p> <p>C.10.1.2    The file of departure, and</p> <p>C.10.1.2    The square of arrival.</p> <p>C.10.2    If both pieces are on the same file by:</p> <p>C.10.2.1    The abbreviation of the name of the piece,</p> <p>C.10.2.2    The rank of the square of departure, and</p> <p>C.10.2.3    The square of arrival.</p> <p>C.10.3    If the pieces are on different ranks and files, method 1 is preferred. Examples:</p> <p>C.10.3.1    There are two knights, on the squares g1 and e1, and one of them moves to the square f3: either Ngf3 or Nef3, as the case may be.</p> <p>C.10.3.2    There are two knights, on the squares g5 and g1, and one of them moves to the square f3: either N5f3 or N1f3, as the case may be.</p> <p>C.10.3.3    There are two knights, on the squares h2 and d4, and one of them moves to the square f3: either Nhf3 or Ndf3, as the case may be.</p> <p>C.10.3.4    If a capture takes place on the square f3, the notation of the previous examples is still applicable, but an x may be inserted: 1) either Ngxf3 or Nexf3, 2) either N5xf3 or N1xf3, 3) either Nhxf3 or Ndxf3, as the case may be.</p> <p>C.11  In the case of the promotion of a pawn, the actual pawn move is indicated, followed immediately by the abbreviation of the new piece.

Chess960 Rules","text":"<p>II.1     Before a Chess960 game a starting position is randomly set up, subject to certain rules. After this, the game is played in the same way as regular chess. In particular, pieces and pawns have their normal moves, and each player's objective is to checkmate the opponent's king.</p> <p>II.2     Starting Position Requirements</p> <p>The starting position for Chess960 must meet certain rules. White pawns are placed on the second rank as in regular chess. All remaining white pieces are placed randomly on the first rank, but with the following restrictions:</p> <p>II.2.1    the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and</p> <p>II.2.2    the bishops are placed on opposite-coloured squares, and</p> <p>II.2.3    the black pieces are placed opposite the white pieces.</p> <p>The starting position can be generated before the game either by a computer program or using dice, coin, cards, etc.</p> <p>II.3     Chess960 castling rules</p> <p>II.3.1    Chess960 allows each player to castle once per game, a move by potentially both the king and rook in a single move. However, a few interpretations of regular chess rules are needed for castling, because the regular rules presume initial locations of the     rook and king that are often not applicable in Chess960.</p> <p>II.3.2    How to castle. In Chess960, depending on the pre-castling position of the castling king and rook, the castling manoeuvre is performed by one of these four methods:</p> <p>II.3.2.1    double-move castling: by making a move with the king and a move with the rook, or</p> <p>II.3.2.2    transposition castling: by transposing the position of the king and the rook, or</p> <p>II.3.2.3    king-move-only castling: by making only a move with the king, or</p> <p>II.3.2.4    rook-move-only castling: by making only a move with the rook.</p> <p>II.3.2.5    Recommendations:</p> <p>When castling on a physical board with a human player, it is recommended that the king be moved outside the playing surface next to his/her final position, the rook then be moved from its starting position to its final position, and then the king be placed on his final square. After castling, the rook and king's final positions should be exactly the same positions as they would be in regular chess. II.3.2.6    Clarification</p> <p>Thus, after c-side castling (notated as 0-0-0 and known as queen-side castling in ortho-dox chess), the king is on the c-square (c1 for white and c8 for black) and the rook is on the d-square (d1 for white and d8 for black). After g-side castling (notated as 0-0 and known as king-side castling in orthodox chess), the king is on the g-square (g1 for white and g8 for black) and the rook is on the f-square (f1 for white and f8 for black).</p> <p>II.3.2.7    Notes</p> <ul> <li>To avoid any misunderstanding, it may be useful to state \u201cI am about to castle\u201d before castling.</li> <li>In some starting positions, the king or rook (but not both) does not move during castling.</li> <li>In some starting positions, castling can take place as early as the first move.</li> <li>All the squares between the king's initial and final squares (including the final square) and all the squares between the rook's initial and final squares (including the final square) must be vacant except for the king and castling rook.</li> <li>In some starting positions, some squares can stay filled during castling that would have to be vacant in regular chess. For example, after c-side castling 0-0-0, it is possible to have a, b, and/or e still filled, and after g-side castling (0-0), it is possible to have e and/or h filled.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"rulebook/#guidelines-iii-games-without-increment-including-quickplay-finishes","title":"Guidelines III.
