## Background

- Design: This should be ambient so as not to compete with the content on the page, so try to avoid high-contrast images or images with lots of text. A template will automatically be applied to your uploaded file, which will tint it blue and fade out the edges. If you don't upload an image here, we'll automatically take a random screenshot and generate a background image from that.
- Usage: This is the image that will be used in the background of your store page.
- Size:	1438px x 810px
